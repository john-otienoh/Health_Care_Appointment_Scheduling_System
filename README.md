# Healthcare appointment scheduling system

The challenge focuses on developing a robust, secure backend service that efficiently manages patient data and enables seamless appointment scheduling with healthcare providers.

## Core Requirements

* Patient Management Create backend functionality to register and manage patient profiles, store basic patient information and contact details, and track patient identification and insurance information.
* Doctor Management Implement features to maintain doctor profiles with specializations and manage doctor availability schedules.
* Appointment Scheduling Build functionality to create appointments between patients and doctors, check doctor availability when scheduling, prevent scheduling conflicts and double-bookings, and manage appointment status changes.
* Simple User Interface Develop a minimal frontend with a framework of your choice to demonstrate and test the core backend functionalities.
* Medical Records Implement basic functionality to store medical records for patients, link records to specific appointments, and implement appropriate access controls for sensitive information.

## Technical Evaluation

* Backend Architecture - Design an efficient and maintainable backend structure with clear component organization. Include sequence diagrams for key processes and a comprehensive database schema diagram.
* API Design & Documentation - Develop RESTful API endpoints following best practices with proper documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI. Implement meaningful error responses and status codes.
* Data Modeling - Design a database schema with appropriate relationships between patients, doctors, and appointments. Implement data validation and ensure referential integrity between entities.
* Security Implementation - Implement authentication and authorization with role-based access controls (OAuth 2.0). 
Secure sensitive healthcare information and document your security approach.
* Error Handling, Performance & Testing - Build comprehensive error handling with proper validation.
* Performance optimizations including asynchronous processing and message queuing (Kafka/RabbitMQ/Redis). 
**Include thorough test coverage of core functionality.**

## Technology Stack

* Backend: Python (Django).
* Frontend: HTML, CSS(bootsrap & Vanilla) and Javascript.
* Database: PostgreSQL.
* Documentation: Swagger/OpenAPI.
